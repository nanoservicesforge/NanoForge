//! # NanoForge
//! This is the Rust interface for the NanoForge project. NanoForge is a tool for packaging
//! nanoservices into Docker images, and then configuring a Rust project to use these nanoservices
//! as dependencies. The end result is that multiple servers and even JavaScript apps can be
//! compiled into one Rust binary.
